      <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t’s 6 a.m. The sun won’t be up for another hour. Instead the glow of a full moon illuminates the sky, it’s reflection glimmering on the waters of Lake Lemon.</p>

      <p>The eerie chirp of unseen birds intermingles with a chorus of the opening and closing of car doors. For the women of the IU rowing team this is routine: another day, another practice.</p>

      <p>Inside the boathouse, the shiny hulls of the racing shells glint under florescent lights. A faint smell of new paint and plaster lingers in the lofty space.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">

          Members of the IU women's rowing team carry the boat to the water during their 6 a.m. practice on a Wednesday at Lake Lemon. "If I show up to practice everyday and give 100 percent, I know that I've done everything I can to help my team succeed," junior Taylor Ruden said.

      <p>Team members begin to file in, spandex, Adidas athletic sandals and Gatorade water bottles aplenty. Some girls finish braiding their ponytails as others put on extra warm layers. One by one they step out into the darkness, carrying paddles and equipment down to the port.</p>

      <p>Nearby a board displays the lineups for the morning’s practice, the pace: “as fast as you can.”</p>

      <p>The IU women’s rowing team was recently ranked 12th in a USA Rowing preseason poll by the Collegiate Rowing Coaches Association.</p>

      <p>The team has slowly been improving and gaining national recognition amongst their elite competitors after placing 11th overall in the country for the second consecutive season at the NCAA Division 1 Rowing Championship last May.</p>

      <p>“We’ve had some really good success the past two years,” Head Coach Steve Peterson said.</p>

      <p>Coach Peterson is optimistic about the team’s prospects as they enter spring training for their upcoming season, but makes it clear there is still work to be done. For the 68 women on the team, sights are set high on winning a national championship.</p>

      <p>Senior rower Rebecca Brougher spells national champions over and over in her head as she’s rowing convinced that if she keeps saying it, it will happen.</p>

      <p>Whether it’s during a 2,000-meter race or just a trial piece in practice, her inner monologue remains steadfast. National champions. National champions. National champions.</p>

      <p>“It’s also a reminder for why I’m doing this,” Brougher said.</p>

      <p>The bright yellow hull cuts through the still waters to the steady thump of the oar handles, the blades slicing the surface. Inside the boat the rowers move in unison, pushing off back and forth in rhythm with their paddles.</p>

      <p>After months of winter training inside, clocking countless miles on the indoor rowing “erg” machines, being able to get back on the water brings new energy to the team.</p>

      <p>The girls train on the water at least two hours every day, testing out new lineups and maximizing speed and consistency in preparation for upcoming races.</p>

      <p>At the helm of the boats are coxswains like junior Taylor Ruden, responsible for steering, executing strategic race plans and voicing encouragement to the rowers.</p>

      <p>As a coxswain one serves as the rowers’ friend sometimes and as a coach and nurturing mother role other times Ruden explained.</p>

      <p>“It’s wearing a lot of different hats,” Ruden said. “You have to be hard on them a little bit, you have to push them to their next level.”</p>

      <p>Ruden, like most coxswains, develops strong relationships with all of her rowers, knowing personal motivators for each.</p>

      <p>“For the majority of the girls on varsity I can tell you one thing about them that gets them going or one thing that they absolutely hate,” she said.</p>

      <p>As for junior rower Emily Barber, such a motivational phrase came from graduated coxswain Karly Kikkert.</p>

      <p>“She would always say ‘you are better, you are faster, you are stronger,’” Barber said.</p>

      <p>Although there are multiple boats and different crews, all of the women are incredibly close, an impressive feat for a team this large. The intense spring training hours and practice within lineups leads to the creation of a deep bond between boatmates.</p>

      <p>Brougher compares the team dynamic to that of a relationship with a sibling: one is very protective of one’s boatmates and would never let anything happen to them, but still hold high expectations.</p>

      <p>“At the end of the day I am going to do everything I can to make sure the other people in my boat have the best experience and best races,” she said.</p>

      <p>All agree the greatest motivation is the team itself.</p>

      <p>“Hearing them put everything they have into it makes you want to give it your all too,” said Barber of listening to her teammates while in the boat.</p>

      <p>Brougher found the best representation was a quote from the biography ”The Boys in the Boat” by Daniel James Brown, the story of the University of Washington men’s crew that represented the U.S. at the 1936 Olympics:</p>

      <p><i>“The ability to disregard his own ambitions, to throw his ego over the gunnels to leave it swirling in the wig of his shell and to pull not just for himself, not just for glory but for the other boys in the boat.”</i></p>

      <p>“Whatever you’re going through doesn’t matter. You need to go harder for them. You owe it to them because they’re doing it for you,” Brougher said.</p>

      <p>Peterson pointed out that this year’s team doesn’t have any natural leaders, but that instead everyone each plays a leadership role in their own way. It is this breadth of talent and dedication to the team as a whole that fosters the team’s ultimate success.</p>

      <p>“It’s not about having one superstar and a bunch of role players,” he said. “Everybody is doing everything for the benefit of the team.”</p>

      <p>“There has to be a lot of respect,” Peterson said. “They have to believe every other person on this team is giving everything that they can to be as good as they can.”</p>

      <p>In order for the boat to go as fast as possible, the eight rowers and coxswain need to think and move as one.</p>

      <p>For Peterson, a former collegiate and Olympic rower himself, the greatest moment is watching when a crew is completely in sync: with the boat moving fast, skimming across the water as smooth as glass, the crew clipping along.</p>

      <p>“As a rower, that’s what you’re always searching for,” Peterson said. “From the outside, where I’m sitting in the coach’s launch, watching them it looks like it could go on forever. It looks effortless.”</p>
