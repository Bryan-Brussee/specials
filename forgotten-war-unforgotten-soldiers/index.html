			<h3>Portraits of seven veterans in Bloomington who fought in the Korean War</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
		<br><br>
		<p>The Korean War broke out June 25, 1950, as 140,000 North Korean troops invaded South Korea. It was the first proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union of the Cold War era.</p>
		<p>Two days after the war broke out, the U.S. government agreed to send troops under United Nations command to the Korean peninsula, which is smaller than Minnesota.  It was the first time forces were sent under a United Nations flag.  During the course of the war, about two million U.S. soldiers were sent to South Korea to protect it from the invading North.</p>
		<p>From 1950 to 1953, more than 10 million Koreans became separated from their families and four million people were killed. Thirty-eight thousand were Americans.</p>
		<p>Despite these sacrifices, the Korean War is considered a forgotten war in American society. Seven veterans in Bloomington, who fought in the Korean War, vividly recall the harsh reality of the war. To them, it is not forgotten, but a hard, bitter, sad, yet proud memory. </p>

		<p>Robert Marty, 86, was drafted Sept. 21, 1950, and sent to Korea in March 1951. Upon arrival, he was trained to use 4.2 mortar. He was in the 7th Infantry Division, 32nd Regiment, Heavy Mortar Company.</p>
		<p>Marty was sent to the Hill 1073 near the Iron Triangle, a major battle area from 1951 to 1953. He was involved in major battles when the Chinese were engaging in a massive offense toward the front line. Between midnight and 3 a.m., he said he had to fight as many as 300 Chinese soldiers rushing the hill with bugles, drums and flags.</p>
		<p>“Hundreds of them came up the hill,” Marty said. “We had flares to see them. We had to kill them. To us, they weren’t people. We called them gooks.”</p>
		<p>In April 1952, he came back to the U.S. Marty worked at J.C. Penney until 1966 and ran his own clothing business in Chicago and New York for 30 years.</p>

		<p>Darrell Hooten, 84, was born and raised in Bloomington. He joined the U.S. Navy on Sept. 24, 1950. After finishing eleven weeks of training, he was sent to Busan, Korea. He became a crew member of the USS Ashtabula, a fleet oiler that refills other ships’ oil.</p>
		<p>His missions were always exposed to Soviet sea mines, planted by North Koreans. In November 1952, he said his ship was hit by twin explosions caused by acetylene torches, which ignited gasoline fumes in her forward hold while it was in Sasebo, Japan. Three sailors were killed, but Hooten was uninjured. Most of the crew were off the ship during the weekend. After the incident, he was transferred to a destroyer, USS Stickell. He was discharged in 1954 and came back to Bloomington.</p>

		<p>He was sent to Heartbreak Ridge, where one of the hardest hill battles occurred during the war.</p>
		<p>“On Heartbreak Ridge, we were so close to the enemy, so the enemy could set up a radio station to broadcast a propaganda message to us," Jordan said. " They even sometimes played American Rock n’ Roll music every night. I was miserable. I was in homesick every time I listened this music”</p>
		<p>On Sept. 27, 1952, Jordan’s eye was wounded by a mortar round at Bloody Ridge, and he was sent to Japan for treatment. He spent three months there before returning to the fight in Korea. On July 1, 1953, he arrived back in the U.S. and was discharged Oct. 4 of the same year.</p>

	“Our platoon leader, second lieutenant Wing, was killed during the skirmish battle on Aug. 8, 1952. The reason I remember that particular time and date are I was supposed to be on the patrol, but somehow I did not go. Lieutenant Wing was from Burbank, California. He was only 22.”

	“The most heartbreaking thing was watching devastation of the land.  I saw two grown Korean men fighting each other just to get a slice of bread. They were hungry and starving to death. Kids wearing lightweight clothing without any shoes, zero degree. They should not deserve that. You cannot believe what I saw."

		<p>John Davis, 88, was sent to Korea in May 1951. He was involved in major hill battles, such as Hill 717, the highest hill located on the north of the 38th parallel.</p>
		<p>“The hill was called 717," Davis said. " Our job was to take the hill back. We spent a day a side of the hill. A little after the daylight, we started to attack. We threw grenades. When we crossed the ditch, there were dead bodies. Some of them were dead a few days. It was a pretty mean and pretty scary thing.”</p>
		<p>Davis said he still remembers his company commander ordered him to kill three female civilians during a mission to either bring back or wipe out anybody in between his company and enemy. The interpreter went up and told any civilian to come out. Davis and his company commander walked to one shack. They found one pregnant and two wounded women. His company commander ordered to him to throw grenades. Davis refused to do it, but someone else threw the grenades and killed the women. He was wounded by mortar fire in September 1951 and was sent back to the U.S.</p>

	“We had a mission one time to go up and wipe out town between us and enemies. When the interpreter said to come out, but three women were still in the village. Our company commander said to me to throw the grenade to them. I said back, 'why don’t you pull the pin and throw?' And he said, 'Are you refusing a direct order?' I said, 'Yes.' One other guy said, 'I will do it Sergeant.' So he threw the grenade. One woman was pregnant and the others were hit their legs by the 50 cal. The legs were full of maggots. They were killed.  Why? Because the commander thought that they were interrupting the battle. He could not trust them.”
