This repository is synced every 15 minutes with the live production servers.

Files that do work:
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS


Files that **do not** work:
* Server-side programming languages - e.g. PHP, Ruby, Python. (This is a security measure)

A few tips:
* Photos should be optimized for the web. Make sure they are RGB and aren't too big. Usually the longest side of the photo should be no more than 1,000 pixels. Ideally, you want to size the images for the size they are being displayed so your project will load as quickly as possible. _(SNworks reserves the right to take down projects that are too large and cause stress on the web servers.)_
