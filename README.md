Save each project in its own folder with an index.html file to show up at http://specials.idsnews.com/project-name

Files that do work:
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS


Files that **do not** work:
* Server-side programming languages - e.g. PHP, Ruby, Python. (This is a security measure)
* **Video Files** - All videos should be hosted on a streaming site, such as YouTube.

A few tips:
* Photos should be optimized for the web. Make sure they are RGB and aren't too big. Usually the longest side of the photo should be no more than 1,000 pixels. Ideally, you want to size the images for the size they are being displayed so your project will load as quickly as possible.
