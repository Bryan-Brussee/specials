		<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>harlene Spierer said the same four words to her daughter every time they said goodbye, no matter what.</p>

		<p>“I miss you already.”</p>

		<p>She wrote the phrase on her Twitter account in December 2014, in between pleas to the person, or people, who know where her daughter is.</p>

		<p>“I always told Lauren ‘I miss you already,’” she wrote. “I still do and always will.”</p>

		<p>Lauren Spierer, the subject of an infamous Bloomington missing person case, has now been missing for five years. She disappeared in the early hours of June 3, 2011.</p>

		<p>Her case was picked up by social media within two days of her disappearance and word spread fast. Search teams scoured Bloomington and its surrounding areas three times a day, every day. Soon, the searches were reduced to twice daily. People stopped showing up by the hundreds.</p>

		<p>But Bloomington never forgot Lauren. The unsolved case hangs heavy over IU, a campus that has seen missing girls both before and after Lauren. Posters from the year she disappeared are still plastered on the insides of shop windows and on the occasional bulletin board.</p>

		<p>Her blue eyes stare from the photo that accompanies the list of attributes that describe her. She’s 4’11, 90 pounds, blonde hair. The posters say she’s 20 years old. She would be 25 this year.</p>

		<p>Despite thousands of tips and no leads, the Bloomington Police Department said in a statement Lauren disappearance “has never been considered or labeled a ‘cold case’ by the Department.”</p>

		<p>Lauren’s parents, her IU community and the town of Bloomington all deserve to know what happened to her, the release reads.</p>

		<p>The police have put an innumerable amount of hours into the Spierer case, and the department has dedicated more than 2,505 hours of overtime to her, the release said.</p>

		<p>And BPD isn’t alone: the FBI, Indiana State Police, Indiana Conservation Officers, Monroe County Sheriff’s Office, IU Police Department, the Indiana National Guard and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children have also aided in the investigation.</p>

		<p>“Even though it has been over 4.5 years since Lauren disappeared,” the police release reads, “The case continues to be a priority for the investigators assigned and there is work being done on the case literally every day.”</p>

		<p>Charlene’s Twitter account exists only for Lauren news. She retweets news stories, asks people to follow the official Find Lauren Spierer account, @NewsOnLaurenS, begs anyone who knows information in 140 characters or less to please come forward.</p>

		<p>“Every morning I wake up with the same question,” she wrote Feb. 13, 2014. “What can I do to help #FindLauren?”</p>

		<p>On holidays, she tweets to Lauren directly: We miss you. We aren’t stopping. The holidays aren’t the same without you.</p>

		<p>The BPD press release ends with a simple plea for tips and information about how to reach the police and access the Lauren Spierer hotline, before ending with the six words that have become a slogan for Spierer’s search: “Remember: Anything small could be big.”</p>

		<p>Almost three years into her disappearance, on May 23, 2014, Charlene expressed doubt Lauren might be alive, though the words themselves are never uttered by her or her husband.</p>

		<p>“I hope Lauren is in a better place,” she wrote. “I know my place is NOT better without her.”</p>

		<h3>Jill Behrman</h3>

		<p>Behrman, 19, was an IU sophomore when she went missing May 31, 2000. Her body was found March 9, 2003 by a hunter in Morgan County, about 100 feet off Warthen Road. She was on a bike ride at the time she went missing, and John Robert Myers II was sentenced for Behrman’s murder in 2006. He reportedly knowingly and intentionally killed her. Behrman probably would have majored in IU’s School of Public Health, according to her father.</p>

		<h3>Crystal Grubb</h3>

		<p>Grubb, 29, went missing Sept. 18, 2010, and was found dead just weeks later on Oct. 1 in a corn field in northern Monroe County off North Showers Road. She died of head injuries, according to the autopsy. Grubb was reportedly last seen by her boyfriend and two other men. She had two daughters, Abby and Rose, six and two, respectively, at the time of Grubb’s death. There were no arrests made in connection to the murder. Now, every year on Oct. 1, Grubb’s mother organizes a walk to honor her memory.</p>

		<h3>Hannah Wilson</h3>

		<p>Wilson, 22, was finishing her senior year at IU when she went missing during the 2015 Little 500 weekend. She was found dead in Brown County on April 24, the same day she was declared missing.</p>

		<p>Bloomington police arrested Daniel Messel and charged him with the murder of Wilson the following day. He is currently being held in the Brown County jail awaiting his trial. Wilson majored in psychology and planned on pursuing a career in sex therapy.</p>
