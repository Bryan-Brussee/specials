	<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>Two years later, she still thinks about that night. It’s all a bit foggy – her assault, the cops showing up at her hospital room, her mom finding out – with several hours missing from her memory. But the lessons, the ones no one should have to learn, remain. </p>

	<p>Kendall Locey was a freshman, only a few weeks into her first semester, when she was raped. That Thursday night in September 2014, she was heading to an off-campus frat party with a group of new friends. It was a house she’d never been to, being thrown by no one she knew.</p>

	<p>She pre-gamed with some friends before leaving the dorms. It was enough to make her tipsy, she remembers, but not so much she didn’t know what was going on. They walked to a house near the IU football stadium.</p>

	<p>As soon as she walked in the door, everyone was funneled into the basement and then almost immediately to the bar.</p>

	<p>Kendall knows she took a shot, but just the one.</p>

	<p>The next thing she remembers was being startled awake the following morning, hazy and hungover. Who is lying next to me? Kendall thought. When did I meet him? How did I get up to his room? When did my clothes come off?</p>

	<p>Hours later, she was lying in a hospital bed, begging a police officer not to call her mom.</p>

	<p>She was only 17 at the beginning of her freshman year – what would her mom think? Would she blame her, accuse her of just being irresponsible?</p>

	<p>Rape had never been something Kendall worried about. Like many other young women, she had trouble thinking of herself as a victim.</p>

	<p>Looking back now on that night, there’s a list of things Kendall wishes she’d known – things she wishes someone older had told her before.</p>

	<br>

	<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>any freshmen don’t realize it, as soon as they step foot on campus they enter the Red Zone – a time when vulnerable new students, particularly freshmen women, are most at risk for sexual assault. Studies nationally have shown a spike in sex crimes between the first week on campus in August to Thanksgiving break in late November.</p>

	<p>Freshmen enter an entirely new environment, not sure of how to act or what’s expected of them. They long to fit in and try new things. They no longer have the protection of their parents and are new to living on their own.</p>

	<p>Unaware of some of the risks, freshmen are sometimes easier to manipulate because of their lack of knowledge or experience, said Ann Skirvin, a SACS (Sexual Assault Crisis Services) counselor at IU.</p>

	<p>Freshmen are also often at a disadvantage due to abstinence-only education during lower levels of schooling, particularly in Indiana, Skirvin added. Rather than waiting until students get to college, she said, there needs to be more emphasis on educating people on consent and sexual assault at a young age.</p>

	<p>“We at IU are trying to make up for years of inadequate sex education in a period of weeks between when they graduate from high school to when they start college,” Skirvin said.</p>

	<p>According to the 2007 College Sexual Assault Study (from the National Institute of Justice), sexual assault was more common among freshmen and sophomores than juniors and seniors.</p>

	<p>More than 50 percent of assaults happen between August and November. Incidents also more commonly occurred from midnight to 6 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, the study found.</p>

	<p>This points to one of the main dangers of college life – a party culture that’s constantly facilitated and nearly impossible to avoid. For many freshmen, it means experimenting with alcohol, drugs and sex for the first time.</p>

	<p>A couple years ago, IU’s Office of Student Ethics conducted its own student survey to gauge attitudes and experiences with sexual assault. Among many key findings was that alcohol was present in 60 to 83 percent of cases. Another was that more assaults occur during a student’s first year on campus.</p>

	<p>But while freshmen admit sexual assault is an issue on college campuses, they never expect to become victims themselves. It’s an after-thought. If it hasn’t happened to them or to anyone they know, it’s not yet real.</p>

	<p>This lack of recognition was clear early this fall when the IDS spoke with freshman women around campus. Many denied feeling unsafe on campus.</p>

	<p>“There’s always the possibility that it could happen, but I haven’t been threatened by it,” said one student in McNutt quad.</p>

	<p>“It’s not a realistic concern for me at this point,” said another.</p>

	<p>“Every time I go to the bathroom I see a poster about a sexual assault campaign. So it must be a thing.”</p>

	<p>When Kendall Locey told her story to other freshmen weeks after the assault, some didn’t believe her. Even of those who did, some insisted they could fight back if they ever ended up in a similar situation.</p>

	<p>Kendall knew how wrong they were.</p>

	<p>“It doesn’t matter how good you are at drinking, or how tough you are, or if you’ve fought a boy before and you won,” she said. “It doesn’t matter. You don’t know what they’re going to do.”</p>

	<p>If Kendall could do that night over, she wouldn’t have gone to a party thrown by strangers. She would’ve brought her own alcohol. She definitely would have gone with girlfriends she knew well, who would make sure she was okay.</p>

	<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ther upperclasswomen who went through similar experiences have advice they wish they could give their freshman selves. Many felt too ashamed to talk about their assault at first. Some blame themselves, thinking if they’d avoided that situation, stayed away from their assaulter, not led that guy on, nothing would have happened. It must have been their own fault.</p>

	<p>Junior Marcia Lewis was assaulted twice as a freshman.</p>

	<p>At one party first semester, a guy pulled down her pants because “he wanted to know if she was actually a girl.” She played it off at first, but wishes she’d said something.</p>

	<p>A few months later, she was sitting on a couch with a guy she barely knew in a room full of friends. He began moving closer to her, touching her leg because he “wanted to feel her muscles.”</p>

	<p>Marcia, who played on IU’s field hockey team her freshman year, always had a lot of guy friends in high school. She never felt uncomfortable around them until then. Those incidents made her want to stay away, and feel as if she had to.</p>

	<p>“I alienated myself,” she said.</p>

	<p>Casey Behling, a 2016 graduate, felt the same way for some time after her assault.</p>

	<p>She had only been on campus for three days when she was assaulted inside a fraternity house.</p>

	<p>That Friday night, she met a cute guy at a party. He kept telling her to take shots, then another and another – but she was the only one drinking. That’s normal, she thought then, that’s just what college is like.</p>

	<p>She took at least 15 shots of tequila, she remembers, and by then could no longer walk. Casey remembers the stranger helping her stand up and taking her back to his dorm room.</p>

	<p>They started making out, but she didn’t want to go any further. As hard as she tried, she couldn’t say no because she was too drunk. She remembers throwing up in the trashcan next to the bed as he raped her.</p>

	<p>For a long time, only a few people knew about what happened – only the ones who helped her that night. She didn’t blame herself, or feel ashamed, but wishes she cared more about herself when it came to boys and alcohol. She wishes she had spoken out about her experience and been more involved throughout college in helping other girls experiencing similar things.</p>

	<p>Senior Jordan Smith, too, was assaulted during her first semester on campus. But it wasn’t until the end of her sophomore year that she realized the incident was even considered sexual assault.</p>

	<p>She is now one of the directors of Safe Sisters, a student group helping to spread awareness about sexual assault to members of Greek life.</p>

	<p>Jordan didn’t think it was a big deal at the time. It was her third week of college – she didn’t know it wasn’t okay.</p>

	<p>Safe Sisters was founded eight years ago, before freshmen – or any students – realized sexual assault was a problem. Even four or five years ago, the first part of their training process was convincing students they should care.</p>

	<p>“The first time they did this training it was like a foreign concept to the women,” Jordan said. “Nobody was comfortable even remotely talking about it.”</p>

	<p>Though people now are less ignorant, discussing sexual assault still isn’t easy. Processing it and understanding it and reporting it all take time and emotional energy some survivors don’t want to go through.</p>

	<p>Sometimes, it’s easier to just pretend it never happened.</p>

	<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>hat night Kendall’s Reed-Hall dorm, freshmen knocked on the doors of floor mates they’d just met. It was only a few weeks in first semester and friend groups were just forming. Seventeen-and 18-year- olds, in their cramped dorm rooms, took shots of cheap vodka, pre-gaming for the first parties of the weekend.</p>

	<p>Kendall went to a party with some guy friends she’d only recently met. She wishes she’d told her roommate – or anyone she knew better – where she was going that night. Even more, she wishes she’d known about the frat’s reputation for drugging and raping girls.</p>

	<aside class="right-wide">
		<p class="quote">&ldquo;Being a freshman is a whirlwind, ya know &mdash; you’re so glad cuz you’re finally free, finally on your own, and you feel so independent &hellip; to the point that you don’t feel susceptible to the things that could set you back.&rdquo;</p>
		<h5>&mdash; Kendall Locey</h5>
	</aside>

	<p>At the party, in the basement of the frat house, it was dark. There were green and purple flashing lights, Kendall remembers, thumping music, a few people in the center of dance floor, others along the wall.</p>

	<p>She took one shot. The rest of the night is missing.</p>

	<p>When she woke up the next morning, the walls around her were unrecognizable, the face next to her without a name. She jolted out of bed, scrambling to find her clothes, trying to remember if she wore underwear the night before, but treading lightly not to wake whoever it was lying in the bed.</p>

	<p>As soon as she gathered her clothes off the floor, Kendall hurried out of the house. She needed to get back to her dorm but had no clue where to turn first. Having spent little time in Bloomington, finding her way around campus was hard enough, let alone finding her way back there.</p>

	<p>“That’s something scary about being a freshman – you physically don’t know where you are,” she said.</p>

	<p>The next 12 hours were as much of a blur as the last 12. Kendall went straight to the IU health center, then to the hospital, where the police showed up to ask her the same questions she’d answered several times that day.</p>

	<p>Kendall couldn’t help but blame herself for what happened. She was the kind of person who always gave the other person the benefit of the doubt.</p>

	<p>“It felt like I was going to be socially sanctioned for this behavior,” she said. “I felt like I fucked up.”</p>

	<p>Because she graduated high school a year early, Kendall started at IU when she was 17. Her mom was already wary of her being away from home so young when she found out about the assault.</p>

	<p>It was 10:30 p.m. on that Friday night when Kendall finally returned to her dorm. She shared a bottle of wine with a friend while trying to process the last 24 hours.</p>

	<p>That’s when she got a call from her mom.</p>

	<p>She was upset – maybe at Kendall, maybe at the situation. But at the time, it didn’t matter. “She was like, ‘well now look what happened,’” Kendall recalls.</p>

	<p>She didn’t think her daughter could handle it. She wanted Kendall to come home.</p>

	<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>wo years later, thousands of new IU freshmen navigate the Red Zone themselves.</p>

	<p>At every party, freshman Lauren Schmitt is the sober friend. She doesn’t drink alcohol, but one night a week all her friends go out. It’s a way for them to counteract the stress of the week, unwind and forget about everything else, Lauren said.</p>

	<p>Because it’s only one night, there are often no limits.</p>

	<p>“It’s just kind of that one night a week people get crazy, and that’s when a lot of accidents happen,” she said.</p>

	<p>While Lauren plays the role of designated driver, taking care of her friends and making sure they get home okay, she watches. As an outsider, she notices things other might not — as her friends and other girls at the party get more and more drunk, she sees the guys watching, waiting.</p>

	<p>“I can see guys wait for them to get drunk,” she says, “and then try to pull them off into rooms.”</p>

	<p>Lauren is aware of how serious sexual assault is on campus. Anyone can get invited to a party, she says. Even if you barely know someone, word gets around. Sometimes, she takes it upon herself to be speak for girls who can’t.</p>

	<p>“I’ve been in situations where I’ve gone into a room and stopped a guy from assaulting a girl,” she said.</p>

	<p>It’s common for freshman girls to attend off-campus fraternity or house parties rather than those at an on-campus fraternity. Because formal sorority rush isn’t until January, by rule they aren’t allowed to enter frats that are part of the IU Greek system.</p>

	<p>Emily Rotundo and Emry Schnell, freshmen living in Foster, said it’s not unusual for a guy to grab at them when they’re dancing at a party. Because rates of sexual assault are higher in college compared to high school, the aggressive environment of college parties came as a shock to Rotundo.</p>

	<p>“I’ll give them a dirty look, but I never actually say anything,” she says.</p>

	<p>“I just kind of walk away,” Schnell adds.</p>

	<p>For freshman Amanda Stelman, adjusting to the size of IU’s campus was the hardest part. Being from a small town, sexual assault was never something she worried about. She would walk at night in the dark by herself and still feel safe.</p>

	<p>She wasn’t educated much at all on sexual assault in high school, maybe for that reason.</p>

	<p>“Out of everything we get educated on I think that’s the least,” Stelman said. “Because they always talk about drugs and alcohol and sex, but sexual assault has never been a big topic.”</p>

	<p>Skirvin echoed this, saying freshmen are often at a disadvantage due to abstinence-only education during lower levels of schooling, particularly in Indiana. Rather than waiting until students get to college, she said, there needs to be more emphasis on educating people on consent and sexual assault at a young age.</p>

	<p>“We at IU are trying to make up for years of inadequate sex education in a period of weeks between when they graduate from high school to when they start college,” Skirvin said.</p>

	<p>Freshman Katrina Nickell had a friend and classmate who was assaulted during high school, so she’s always conscious of the possibility of that happening to her, too. If a guy at a party grabs her from behind and wants to dance with her, Nickell feels uncomfortable.</p>

	<p>Over the summer, Nickell and her new roommate met with both of their parents for the first time. The parents worried about safety on a campus often known for girls going missing. So, the first thing they warned their daughters of was leaving each other alone.</p>

	<p>That was Kendall two years ago, abandoned in a strange house by her friends.</p>

	<p class="stars">* * *</p>

	<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>efore she could process it, Kendall disguised her assault in many areas of her life. She put pressure on her other relationships in an effort to fix what had happened. She was extra careful to be safe so her mom wouldn’t try to pull her out of school again.</p>

	<p>Kendall never went to another frat party, which, at the time, made her fear she was missing out on the college experience.</p>

	<p>In the few weeks after her assault, she couldn’t fully focus on anything else in her life. She felt the memory of that night lingering in the back of her mind.</p>

	<p>“It’s just something you can’t help thinking about,” she said.</p>

	<p>She would still hang out and drink with close friends in those weeks, but stayed in the dorms. Spending time with them was more of a way to distract herself than anything else.</p>

	<p>Kendall, now a junior, lives in a house with five girls. They look after each other, make sure they get home okay every night, only go to parties thrown by people they know. She feels safety she only wishes existed that fall, when everything was new.</p>

The time period between a freshman's first week on campus in August and Thanksgiving Break in late November is known as the Red Zone, when young students are more vulnerable and at risk for sexual assault. There are many things Kendall wishes she had known prior to that night.</h6>
